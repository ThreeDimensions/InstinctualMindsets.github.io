			<h2>What is Six Triangles?</h2>
			<p>Six Triangles is a political alignment quiz that attempts to place your beliefs in 6 triangles. Many quizzes use 2d scales, where you are, for example, democratic or authoritarian. However, some people may believe that the government should have little say in their lives, whether democratic or authoritarian, and thus, they might vote no to both democratic and authoritarian questions. This quiz attempts to resolve that by measuring the combination of 3 attributes. While this isn't perfect, it aims to be able to give a better method of comparison than most quizzes.
			<h2>What are the triangles?</h2>

			<h2>Yet Another Quiz?</h2>
			<p>As I receive feedback on this quiz, I've been realizing that there's several things I can do better, but due to substantial differences, it's not really possible to modify this website to have these new changes (which as far as I know have not been used in any major political quiz). Additionally, making major changes to this website is difficult, as the other languages were translated by volunteers, and if I just update the English site, the other languages will not remain up to date, and I will either have to stop supporting them or have to deal with making multiple variations of the quiz work. As such, for the new Political Quiz I'm designing, I want to address as many issues as possible before I publish it and people translate it. For this reason, I want to run surveys ahead of time to get a better understanding of both what axes are important to people and any desired features. The second survey is here: <a href="https://forms.gle/f9K4yxc93JXcrro66">https://forms.gle/f9K4yxc93JXcrro66</a>. This will probably be the last survey, though by completing it, you will receive an invite to a discord server that you can optionally join to test specific multiple-choice questions for the new quiz. If you want to ensure your views are represented and that the features you want are included, filling this survey out will help me better understand and ensure they are included!</p>
			<h2>Bilingual?</h2>
			<p>The website is set up so the quiz can support multiple languages. If you know a language that's not on here (or spot a typo/error in one that is), feel free to <a href="https://github.com/sixtriangles/sixtriangles.github.io/issues/new">open an issue</a> or send an email to sixtrianglespoliticalquiz@gmail.com to help translate it. :)</p>
